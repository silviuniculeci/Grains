## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ Feature description parsed: Bilingual OpenGrains app with OCR document processing
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Actors: Sales agents, farmers/suppliers, back office staff, procurement team
   ’ Actions: Document photography, OCR processing, profile validation, target management, offer processing
   ’ Data: Bilingual interface, Romanian business documents, IBAN extraction, purchase targets
   ’ Constraints: Multi-language support, Romanian legal compliance, OCR accuracy requirements
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Specific Romanian document types and validation rules]
   ’ [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: OCR accuracy thresholds and fallback procedures]
   ’ [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Target calculation algorithms and zone definitions]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ Primary flows identified for bilingual agent workflow and OCR processing
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Requirements defined for i18n, document OCR, target management, offer processing
6. Identify Key Entities
   ’ Document, OCRResult, PurchaseTarget, Offer, Supplier entities identified
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ WARN "Spec has uncertainties regarding OCR thresholds and target calculations"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning with clarifications needed)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story

**Bilingual Sales Agent Workflow**: A sales agent visits a Romanian farmer and uses the application in Romanian language. They complete the supplier profiling form (Contact) including the nearest delivery location, photograph required Romanian business documents (ONRC certificate, farmer ID/business card, APIA certificate, bank statement with IBAN), and upload them to the application. The system processes these documents using OCR to automatically extract key information like IBAN numbers from bank statements.

**Enhanced Supplier Self-Service**: The supplier receives a link and accesses the application in their preferred language (English or Romanian). They complete their Contact profile and upload mandatory documents for legal entities (PJ) or individuals (PF) including business certificates, farmer credentials, and banking information. The OCR system automatically extracts relevant data from uploaded documents.

**Intelligent Back Office Processing**: Back office staff review supplier profiles with OCR-extracted data pre-populated. If accepted, the system validates the profile, assigns permissions, automatically updates the agent's purchase target dashboard showing target vs. potential by zone, and generates separate profile/target reports. Suppliers can then submit grain sales offers or input purchase requests to the procurement team.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a sales agent is using the app in Romanian, **When** they photograph a Romanian bank statement and upload it, **Then** the OCR system extracts the IBAN automatically and populates the banking information field
2. **Given** a supplier accesses the registration link, **When** they select Romanian as their language preference, **Then** all interface elements, forms, and instructions are displayed in Romanian
3. **Given** back office staff approve a supplier profile, **When** the approval is processed, **Then** the system automatically updates the sales agent's target dashboard with new potential vs. target metrics for that zone
4. **Given** an approved supplier submits a grain sales offer, **When** the offer is created, **Then** it is automatically routed to the procurement team for processing
5. **Given** a user uploads a low-quality document image, **When** OCR processing fails to extract required data, **Then** the system prompts for manual data entry with clear instructions

### Edge Cases

- What happens when OCR fails to extract IBAN from a bank statement due to poor image quality?
- How does the system handle Romanian diacritical marks and special characters in document text?
- What occurs when a supplier's documents don't match the expected Romanian legal entity formats?
- How are discrepancies handled between OCR-extracted data and manually entered information?
- What happens when target calculations result in negative values or unrealistic projections?
