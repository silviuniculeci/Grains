# Implementation Plan: OpenGrains Bilingual Supplier Engagement with OCR Integration

**Branch**: `002-bilingual-ocr-enhancement` | **Date**: 2025-09-18 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/002-bilingual-ocr-enhancement/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → Feature spec loaded: Bilingual OpenGrains with OCR document processing
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Project Type: web (enhanced frontend + OCR backend integration)
   → Structure Decision: Extended web application with AI/ML services
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → Constitution is template-only, proceeding with enhanced development practices
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → Resolved: i18n libraries, OCR integrations, Romanian compliance, target algorithms
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, CLAUDE.md
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → No violations detected in enhanced design
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Task generation approach described
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Primary requirement: Enhance existing OpenGrains supplier engagement with comprehensive bilingual support (English/Romanian) and intelligent OCR document processing for Romanian business documents. Technical approach extends React frontend with i18n capabilities and integrates OpenAI OCR services for automated IBAN extraction and document validation, while adding target management and offer processing workflows.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: TypeScript/JavaScript (React ecosystem) + Node.js backend services
**Primary Dependencies**: React, react-i18next, shadcn/ui, OpenAI API, React Hook Form, Zod validation
**Storage**: PostgreSQL for structured data, cloud storage for document images, Redis for OCR cache
**Testing**: Vitest/Jest with React Testing Library, OCR mocking, i18n testing
**Target Platform**: Web browsers (modern) with mobile camera support
**Project Type**: web - enhanced frontend with AI/ML backend services
**Performance Goals**: <3s OCR processing, <1s language switching, 95% IBAN extraction accuracy
**Constraints**: Romanian legal compliance, GDPR data handling, multilingual accessibility
**Scale/Scope**: 2 languages, 5 Romanian document types, zone-based target calculations

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

Constitution file contains template placeholders only. Following enhanced development practices:
- Bilingual-first architecture design
- OCR accuracy validation and fallback procedures
- Romanian legal compliance validation
- Data privacy and security for document processing

**Status**: PASS (no specific constitutional constraints defined)

**Structure Decision**: Extended Web application - Enhanced frontend with specialized backend services

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context**:
   - React i18n best practices with shadcn/ui integration
   - OpenAI Vision API for Romanian document OCR
   - Romanian IBAN validation and banking formats
   - Target calculation algorithms and zone management
   - Romanian business document compliance requirements

2. **Generate and dispatch research**:
   - Task: "Research react-i18next setup with shadcn/ui and Romanian language support"
   - Task: "Find best practices for OpenAI Vision API document OCR integration"
   - Task: "Research Romanian IBAN validation standards and banking formats"
   - Task: "Find patterns for target calculation systems and geographical zones"
   - Task: "Research Romanian business document types and compliance requirements"

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md`

**Output**: research.md with technology decisions and implementation patterns

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Enhanced Supplier with language preferences and zones
   - Romanian Document types with OCR processing
   - OCR Result with confidence scoring and validation
   - Purchase Target with zone-based calculations
   - Sales Offer and Input Purchase Request workflows

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - POST /api/ocr/process - Process document images
   - GET /api/languages/{locale} - Get translation resources
   - PUT /api/users/{id}/language - Update language preference
   - GET /api/targets/zones - Get zone-based targets
   - POST /api/offers - Submit sales offers
   - POST /api/purchases - Submit input purchase requests

3. **Generate contract tests** for enhanced endpoints:
   - OCR processing accuracy and error handling
   - Language switching and translation validation
   - Target calculation verification
   - Romanian document validation tests

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Bilingual sales agent workflow with OCR
   - Romanian document processing and validation
   - Target dashboard updates and zone calculations
   - Offer submission and procurement routing

5. **Update CLAUDE.md incrementally**:
   - Add i18n and OCR processing context
   - Add Romanian business compliance patterns
   - Add target calculation and zone management

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, CLAUDE.md

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- i18n setup and translation management tasks
- OCR integration and document processing tasks
- Romanian compliance and validation tasks
- Target calculation and zone management tasks
- Enhanced UI components for bilingual experience

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Enhanced tests before implementation
- Dependency order: i18n → OCR → Target Management → Offers
- Parallel execution: Independent language/OCR components marked [P]

**Estimated Output**: 35-40 numbered tasks for enhanced implementation

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)
**Phase 4**: Implementation (i18n, OCR, target management, offer processing)
**Phase 5**: Validation (accuracy testing, compliance verification, user acceptance)

## Complexity Tracking
*Enhanced features require additional complexity management*

| Enhancement | Why Needed | Complexity Justification |
|-------------|------------|--------------------------|
| Bilingual Support | Romanian market requirement | Essential for user adoption in Romania |
| OCR Integration | Automate document processing | Reduces manual data entry errors |
| Target Management | Sales performance tracking | Core business requirement for growth |
| Romanian Compliance | Legal and business requirements | Mandatory for Romanian operations |
