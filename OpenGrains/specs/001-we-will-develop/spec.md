# Feature Specification: OpenGrains Supplier Engagement Module

**Feature Branch**: `001-we-will-develop`
**Created**: 2025-09-18
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "we will develop an application called OpenGrains, the application will be based on the core processes involved in the purchase and sale of grains, with additional layers to be developed later to fulfill the complete requirements of the application users. We will start with developing the UI of the Supplier Engagement module, the process of activating suppliers for a company, involving multiple stages. The sales agent visits the farmer, completes the profiling form, and uploads the necessary documents to the BPM system, or the supplier accesses a link (provided by Ameropa) to complete the profile and upload the necessary documents. The commercial back office validates the supplier profile, and if accepted, permissions are granted, and the supplier is registered in the system. The supplier can then be used in purchase requests, completing the procurement process. The purchasing process itself is internally coordinated by the OpenGrains sales agent using contacts already provided by the supplier., we will focus on UI using shadcn libraries"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Feature description parsed: OpenGrains Supplier Engagement Module UI
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: Sales agents, farmers/suppliers, commercial back office staff
   ‚Üí Actions: Profile completion, document upload, validation, registration, purchase requests
   ‚Üí Data: Supplier profiles, documents, contacts, permissions
   ‚Üí Constraints: Multi-stage process, validation required, document upload capability
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Specific validation criteria for supplier profiles]
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Document types and format requirements]
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Permission levels and access controls]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Primary flows identified for agent-assisted and self-service supplier onboarding
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Requirements defined for profile forms, document upload, validation workflow
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí Supplier, Profile, Documents, Permissions, Sales Agent entities identified
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí WARN "Spec has uncertainties regarding validation criteria and document requirements"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning with clarifications needed)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
**Sales Agent Assisted Onboarding**: A sales agent visits a farmer to onboard them as a supplier. The agent completes a profiling form with the farmer's information, uploads required documents to the system, and submits the profile for validation by the commercial back office. Once approved, the supplier is registered and can be used in purchase requests.

**Self-Service Onboarding**: A potential supplier receives a link from Ameropa and accesses the supplier onboarding portal. They complete their profile information, upload required documents, and submit for validation. After approval by the commercial back office, they gain access to the system.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a sales agent is visiting a farmer, **When** they complete the supplier profiling form with all required information and upload necessary documents, **Then** the profile is submitted to the commercial back office for validation
2. **Given** a supplier receives an Ameropa onboarding link, **When** they access the link and complete their profile with required documents, **Then** their submission is queued for commercial back office review
3. **Given** the commercial back office receives a supplier profile, **When** they validate and approve the profile, **Then** the supplier is registered in the system with appropriate permissions
4. **Given** a supplier is registered and approved, **When** a purchase request is created, **Then** the supplier can be selected and contacted using their provided information

### Edge Cases
- What happens when required documents are missing or in incorrect format?
- How does the system handle partial profile submissions that are saved but not submitted?
- What occurs when the commercial back office rejects a supplier profile?
- How are duplicate supplier submissions handled?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a supplier profiling form that captures essential supplier information
- **FR-002**: System MUST allow document upload functionality for required supplier documentation
- **FR-003**: Sales agents MUST be able to complete supplier profiles on behalf of farmers during visits
- **FR-004**: Suppliers MUST be able to access a self-service portal via a provided link to complete their own profiles
- **FR-005**: System MUST route completed supplier profiles to commercial back office for validation
- **FR-006**: Commercial back office staff MUST be able to review, approve, or reject supplier profiles
- **FR-007**: System MUST register approved suppliers with appropriate permissions for system access
- **FR-008**: Registered suppliers MUST be available for selection in purchase request processes
- **FR-009**: System MUST store supplier contact information for use in procurement coordination
- **FR-010**: System MUST track the status of supplier profiles throughout the onboarding process
- **FR-011**: System MUST provide [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific validation criteria for profiles not defined]
- **FR-012**: System MUST support [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: document types and format requirements not specified]
- **FR-013**: System MUST implement [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: permission levels and access controls not detailed]
- **FR-014**: System MUST handle [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: notification process for profile status updates not specified]
