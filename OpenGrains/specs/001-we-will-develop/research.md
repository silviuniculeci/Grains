# Research: OpenGrains Supplier Engagement Module

## shadcn/ui Setup and Best Practices

**Decision**: Use shadcn/ui as the primary component library
**Rationale**:
- Built on Radix UI primitives providing accessibility out of the box
- Tailwind CSS styling allows for easy customization
- Copy-paste approach gives full control over components
- Strong TypeScript support and form integration patterns
- Active community and comprehensive documentation

**Alternatives considered**:
- Ant Design: More opinionated, harder to customize
- Chakra UI: Good but less modern approach to styling
- Material-UI: Heavy bundle size, Google design language may not fit

**Implementation approach**:
- Initialize with `npx shadcn-ui@latest init`
- Install core components: Button, Input, Form, Card, Dialog, Progress
- Use Tailwind for custom styling and responsive design
- Follow shadcn/ui form patterns with React Hook Form integration

## File Upload Handling Patterns

**Decision**: Use react-dropzone with chunked upload for large files
**Rationale**:
- Drag and drop interface improves user experience
- Progress tracking essential for document uploads
- Chunked uploads handle network interruptions gracefully
- File type validation and size limits prevent issues

**Alternatives considered**:
- Native HTML input: Limited UX, no progress tracking
- Custom solution: More development time, reinventing the wheel
- Third-party services (Uploadcare): External dependency, cost

**Implementation approach**:
- react-dropzone for drag/drop interface
- axios with upload progress for API calls
- File validation on client side (type, size)
- Resume capability for interrupted uploads
- Preview functionality for uploaded documents

## Multi-step Form Patterns

**Decision**: React Hook Form with Zod validation and stepper component
**Rationale**:
- React Hook Form provides excellent performance with minimal re-renders
- Zod schemas enable type-safe validation shared between frontend/backend
- Step-based validation allows partial saves and better UX
- Form state persistence prevents data loss

**Alternatives considered**:
- Formik: More complex API, performance issues with large forms
- Native useState: Too much boilerplate, poor validation patterns
- React Final Form: Less active maintenance

**Implementation approach**:
- useForm hook with mode: "onChange" for real-time validation
- Zod schemas for each form step
- Context API for cross-step state management
- LocalStorage for draft persistence
- Stepper component from shadcn/ui for navigation

## TypeScript Entity Modeling

**Decision**: Domain-driven design patterns with strict types
**Rationale**:
- Clear separation between API types and domain entities
- Compile-time validation prevents runtime errors
- Better IDE support and refactoring capabilities
- Shared types between components reduce coupling

**Alternatives considered**:
- Loose typing with any: Loss of type safety
- PropTypes: Runtime validation, no compile-time benefits
- Interface-only approach: Missing validation and transformation logic

**Implementation approach**:
- Base entity interfaces for common patterns
- Branded types for IDs to prevent mixing
- Zod schemas that generate TypeScript types
- Transformation utilities between API and domain types
- Status enums for workflow states

## Form State Management Architecture

**Decision**: Combination of React Hook Form + Context API + LocalStorage
**Rationale**:
- React Hook Form handles individual form validation and submission
- Context API manages cross-component state (user role, current step)
- LocalStorage provides persistence for draft data
- Clear separation of concerns

**Implementation approach**:
```typescript
// Form level: React Hook Form
const form = useForm<SupplierProfileForm>({
  resolver: zodResolver(supplierProfileSchema),
  mode: 'onChange'
})

// Application level: Context
const SupplierOnboardingContext = createContext<{
  currentStep: number
  userRole: UserRole
  draftData: Partial<SupplierProfile>
}>()

// Persistence level: LocalStorage hook
const useDraftPersistence = (key: string) => {
  // Auto-save form data to localStorage
  // Restore on component mount
}
```

## Responsive Design Strategy

**Decision**: Mobile-first design with Tailwind CSS breakpoints
**Rationale**:
- Form-heavy applications need careful mobile optimization
- Tailwind provides consistent breakpoint system
- Progressive enhancement from mobile to desktop
- shadcn/ui components are responsive by default

**Implementation approach**:
- sm: 640px (tablets)
- md: 768px (small laptops)
- lg: 1024px (desktops)
- xl: 1280px (large screens)

Mobile optimizations:
- Single column layouts on mobile
- Larger touch targets for buttons
- Simplified navigation patterns
- File upload with camera integration

## Accessibility Requirements

**Decision**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance with focus management
**Rationale**:
- Legal requirements for business applications
- Better usability for all users
- shadcn/ui provides accessible primitives
- Screen reader support essential for forms

**Implementation approach**:
- Semantic HTML structure
- ARIA labels and descriptions
- Focus management for multi-step forms
- Color contrast compliance
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader testing with key user flows
