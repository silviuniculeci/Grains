# Implementation Plan: OpenGrains Supplier Engagement Module

**Branch**: `001-we-will-develop` | **Date**: 2025-09-18 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-we-will-develop/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → Feature spec loaded successfully: OpenGrains Supplier Engagement Module
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Project Type: web (frontend + backend UI focus)
   → Structure Decision: Option 2 (Web application)
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → Constitution is template-only, proceeding with standard practices
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → Resolved: UI framework (shadcn), form handling, file upload
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, CLAUDE.md
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → No violations detected in design
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Task generation approach described
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Primary requirement: Create UI for supplier onboarding process with dual pathways (sales agent-assisted and self-service) including profile forms, document upload, and validation workflow. Technical approach focuses on React frontend using shadcn/ui component library with form handling and file upload capabilities.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: TypeScript/JavaScript (React ecosystem)
**Primary Dependencies**: React, shadcn/ui, React Hook Form, Zod validation, Lucide icons
**Storage**: LocalStorage for draft state, API endpoints for persistence
**Testing**: Vitest/Jest with React Testing Library
**Target Platform**: Web browsers (modern)
**Project Type**: web - determines frontend structure with API integration points
**Performance Goals**: <2s form load time, responsive file upload with progress
**Constraints**: Modern browser compatibility, accessible UI components, mobile-responsive
**Scale/Scope**: 3 main user types, 5-7 key forms, document upload handling

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

Constitution file contains template placeholders only. Following standard web development practices:
- Component-based architecture
- Type-safe development with TypeScript
- Form validation and error handling
- Accessible UI components from shadcn/ui

**Status**: PASS (no specific constitutional constraints defined)

**Structure Decision**: Option 2 (Web application) - Frontend-focused with API integration points

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context**:
   - shadcn/ui setup and configuration best practices
   - File upload handling patterns for React
   - Form state management for multi-step forms
   - TypeScript patterns for supplier entity modeling

2. **Generate and dispatch research**:
   - Task: "Research shadcn/ui setup and best practices for form-heavy applications"
   - Task: "Find best practices for file upload in React with progress tracking"
   - Task: "Research multi-step form patterns and state management"
   - Task: "Find TypeScript patterns for domain entity modeling"

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md`

**Output**: research.md with technology decisions and implementation patterns

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Supplier: contact info, business details, status
   - Profile: form data, validation state, timestamps
   - Document: file metadata, upload status, validation
   - User roles: SalesAgent, CommercialBackOffice, Supplier

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - POST /api/suppliers - Create supplier profile
   - PUT /api/suppliers/{id} - Update supplier profile
   - POST /api/suppliers/{id}/documents - Upload documents
   - GET /api/suppliers/{id}/status - Get validation status
   - PUT /api/suppliers/{id}/approve - Approve/reject (back office)

3. **Generate contract tests** for API endpoints:
   - Schema validation tests for each endpoint
   - Request/response format tests
   - Error handling tests

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Sales agent onboarding flow test
   - Self-service supplier registration test
   - Back office validation workflow test

5. **Update CLAUDE.md incrementally**:
   - Add React/TypeScript context
   - Add shadcn/ui component patterns
   - Add form handling and validation patterns

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, CLAUDE.md

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Component development tasks (forms, upload, validation UI)
- API integration tasks (service layer, type definitions)
- User workflow tasks (routing, state management)
- Testing tasks (component tests, integration tests)

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Component tests before implementation
- Dependency order: Base components → Forms → Pages → Integration
- Parallel execution: Independent components marked [P]

**Estimated Output**: 20-25 numbered tasks for UI development

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)
**Phase 4**: Implementation (React components, forms, integration)
**Phase 5**: Validation (component tests, user acceptance testing)

## Complexity Tracking
*No constitutional violations detected - using standard React patterns*

## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*

**Phase Status**:
- [x] Phase 0: Research complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 1: Design complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 2: Task planning complete (/plan command - describe approach only)
- [ ] Phase 3: Tasks generated (/tasks command)
- [ ] Phase 4: Implementation complete
- [ ] Phase 5: Validation passed

**Gate Status**:
- [x] Initial Constitution Check: PASS
- [x] Post-Design Constitution Check: PASS
- [x] All NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved
- [x] Complexity deviations documented (none required)
